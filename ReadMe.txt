Name: Ethan Chen
Date Completed: November 19, 2019

Main Files:

    BinarySearchTree - implements the binary search tree and a runnable test client to test methods, also shows my
                       (unsuccessful) attempt at an iterator for the tree
    AnimalBT - code for altered binary search tree with string key instead of int key, iterative put and delte
               methods instead of recursive (more on this in comments in file)
    Animals - code to run the Animals game in the console. Is able to read and write questions and objects to external file on my desktop
    AnimalGraphicsUISuccess - Graphics implementation of the Animals game, with all the same functionality as the console program
    AnimalForm - The JFrame class that contains all the code for the Animal Graphics. Completely event based, as requested.

Extra Files:

    Node - Node class, modified to have an int key and String key, as well as have a right and left node pointer for tree
    AnimalGraphicsUITry1 - my forever-running unsuccessful graphics file that only works in the debugger
    animalQuestions.txt - an example of a text file that might be pulled from for Animals game

Notes:
    I hope this meets/exceeds the expectations. Have a great break Mr. Bakker!
